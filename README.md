# PyCon Workshop 2025

Welcome to the PyCon Workshop 2025! This repository contains the materials for the workshop.
The workshop is designed to help you learn and practice Python programming in a fun and interactive way.

The main target is to give you a simple taste of what you can easily build with tools as streamlit.

First of all you need to install the dependencies. To do so, you can use `poetry` or `pip`.

My personal preference relies on poetry.
